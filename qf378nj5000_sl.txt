the lane off of Cecilia Busiaga.
I mean, everything just, like, piled on, piled on
and so many things were happening that we say,
wait, we need to do something about it
and we need to change what's going on
because nothing's happening that we want to happen.
No, I'm tired, I'm sorry.
Can we close this up?
So, can we go wonder if I knew I needed to take a dressing
made measure like this?
I don't think we'll see what you mean.
Because the administration has been very,
whenever we've had meetings and townhouse meetings or whatever,
because together with any of the administrators,
we don't get any results that we're happy with.
And so, it seemed to me like, for them to really understand
how extreme the situation is on this campus and how extreme
things are outside in terms of immigrant bashing
and just the way that people in East Palo Alto are
that it was maybe the only way that they would,
I don't know if it would touch their heart
or if they would just stop.
Think about it or if we could get enough that press
with this university so that they could finally just really
think about it.
Because otherwise, they weren't paying attention
to, like, everything had to go business as usual
and there seemed to be this idea about hierarchy here
that it was from time down.
And it was what they said first and then,
if we could deal with that, we a students could deal with
and see what the university wanted, that was fine.
We couldn't, that's too bad because they're
at their position because, you know, they earned it
or whatever.
Yeah, because meeting after meeting like,
you didn't get anything concrete from meeting
with them every single time.
It was just, okay, I'll give you a meeting from 67.
I'll give you a meeting from 530 to 6 or whatever.
We've tried their methods.
We've tried their methods of working things out
for as long as possible.
In order to not give us things,
at least, you know, they may say differently,
but that's what it feels like and it's ridiculous
to have to spend, I'm sorry, I'm slow,
but a little bit tired.
It's ridiculous to spend so much time
just talking and talking about things
and, you know, they're trying to tire us out
which is talking.
So that's what it had to come to.
And, you know, when people are not heard,
you know, and this happens in society at large
when people are not heard.
Yeah, you know, I don't know if I want to say
normal behaviors, but, you know, behaviors
that are not normal.
And, you know, behaviors that are not normal
are what happened.
And, yeah, this is not normal.
You know, it's not normal behavior for us
to be, you know, not eating.
But, you know,
we like to eat.
And, you know, it just, I emphasize, you know,
why would you come to prison?
Why would you come to, you know, in poverty?
That's not normal.
That's not normal for people.
But, because of society, that's how we are.
And, we've waited long enough for this.
I mean, I know the administration is probably
thinking, well, you know, be patient
and these changes will happen.
But, we've been patient long enough
and, you know, the Chicano studies major
has been, it was envisioned back in the 70s,
even the 60s.
And, we've been waiting since then.
And it's about time that we get recognized.
You know, Chicano's are the biggest
armage, are coming to be a majority in California.
And, you know, maybe even in the whole country,
after a while.
But, I mean, it's about time that our issues get recognized
and that other people just, just realize it,
we're not going to go away.
And if they don't educate themselves about us,
then it's just going to be worse for them.
What have you co-authored on?
They're really beautiful from on and on.
Some of us might have it.
What we're using is significant,
what we have before Chicano's taking the Vanguard role
in this movement, which is really bigger than this campus.
For me, I mean, I don't know.
We didn't really realize it was for women
till somebody pointed it out to us.
I mean, we knew it was girls,
but we didn't see it like, you know,
oh, you know, there's no guys here, you know,
like, you know, what's up with the guys?
But, I don't know.
I mean, we have a lot of supporters that are male,
and maybe they didn't say they're going to go for the long run,
but they've been there the whole time.
Everybody has their roles,
and it's like, there's some people that are the negotiators.
There's people that are security over here.
There's like, everybody has their roles,
and you know, we're not the most important
because if it wasn't for them,
then you know, nobody would be listening to us or whatever.
And there's other people that have been fascinating,
also like Felipe Serino, Barri√°n.
He's been fasting these three days with us as well,
like there's people that committed to three days
and others that do one one day cycles
to show their support and solidarity.
It's true that there are a lot of males that are doing really important stuff.
In terms of really trying, you know,
like with the rest of the women also,
trying to take care of us and trying to watch out for this
and they're just constantly looking out to see
what, you know, what we need or what
needs to be done for the whole group.
And so I don't know.
I don't know that it's specifically a female thing
to be fasting or anything like that.
Because everybody really does have their own role
and everybody's been really supportive and working together
through the activities.
It just so happened that we were the ones that
it was that, you know, we're the ones that
that, you know, we're ready mentally at this time
to fast.
And, you know, it just so happens that we're all women.
And people are kind as to get a year
and revolts on our lives and all that.
That's, that's, I mean, that's fine.
That's what life is like.
That's what life is like.
That's what life is like.
That's what life is like.
But I mean, everybody's been professionally.
And, you know, it's a conversation like I'm everybody.
Yeah, it comes down to, like, what you, you know,
I don't want to say it.
I don't think our time is to be hungry, but
but we were like, everybody is taking on the role
that is best suited for themselves.
There's Felipe.
There's Felipe.
You know, all the things that you could have done
of all the actions you could have taken.
Why, fasting?
Why did you choose to fasting?
Well, it's obviously a really strong statement.
You know, it's something that
it's uncompromising.
And it's something that shows just how serious
we are about these issues.
There are issues that our fathers,
ground fathers, and people way before us,
and, you know, have fought for them.
We have a responsibility to those ancestors of ours
to make sure that those dreams that they had,
that vision they had is fulfilled.
We can't just, you know,
it may be 20 years, 20 or 20 years later
from the Chicano movement that people think is dead.
But it's not dead.
We're here and we're living.
And we're the Chicano movement.
And Chicano movement.
Yeah.
Chicano movement.
Chicano movement.
Felipe, you just joined us,
but actually you've been with us throughout this whole struggle
from the beginning, as was pointed out,
you tell us a lot about yourself, where you're from,
and your reflection on this struggle.
Sure.
My name is Felipe Waderion.
My freshman, originally from Los Angeles, California.
Um, this struggle, I think, for me,
it's something that's very important.
Because, um, I went to high school in Watts.
And a lot of people know what Watts is like,
1965, um, Watts revealed me in the 90 riots.
There are, I saw issues that,
that the educational system,
for high school students in Chicano,
Latinos there, wasn't addressing the real issues.
Once I came here, I got a taste of it.
I came out a taste of Chicano studies.
And I found out how crucial that was.
Um, and I think that, um,
getting involved with the struggle is important for me
to, to build the, uh, the processes,
with which we learn to deal with inner city,
to wipe out the, um,
marginalization of our people.
You know, in terms of, um,
your actions.
You know, a lot of people are probably thinking
that you came here to study,
and that you should be in the classroom,
not, you know,
protesting.
And so you're making a decision,
because it is,
it is a pretty tough university to be at.
And there's a lot of demands
and we're kind of out there really taking a big chance.
You know, how did you make that decision?
See, I guess, like, the main thing is,
like, I never, like, when I came here,
I didn't want to come and just study and go to class
and go back home, study, do my work,
and just concentrate on myself.
While there's people out there,
there's students in the high schools
that are getting pushed out of the schools,
there's, you know,
the farm workers that are getting treated badly,
just kids being born with their hands,
because the pesticides that they put on the grapes.
I mean, I can't just sit and concentrate on my own work,
and not worry about what's going on,
because, you know, that's, that's my people,
that's my parents, that's my family,
that's, you know, everybody.
And I wouldn't be able to live with myself
without doing anything about it.
I wouldn't be able to live with myself
with just thinking about myself and my career
and getting straight days and doing my resumes
and stuff like that.
I wouldn't be able to do that.
I mean, both things can be done.
So, like, I think that we're doing this
so that, you know, later generations
of Stanford, Chicano's, and Chicano's,
don't have to do it.
Today we had, you know, a little Chicano doesn't
Chicano's from East Palo Alto, come out
and from Avalejo, Puerto Rico, called Dreses and Mexico.
And they came out and there, you know,
they came out and supported us.
You know, they're just little kids.
I don't know.
They're probably like from five to like 12, maybe.
And, you know, the reason we're doing this now
and sacrificing our academic time
or study hours or whatever.
You know, so that they, when they come here,
you know, they can focus, you know,
on doing the things that they need to do
instead of having to struggle so much.
I mean, I think it's just like our parents, you know,
they struggle so that we don't have to struggle.
And we don't, I mean, we don't struggle.
We're still struggling, but at a different level.
And I mean, we're not, I mean,
we don't have to worry.
Once we get out of here,
we're not going to have to worry about
or am I going to get something to eat
like before or how are we going to pay the bills?
Or we're probably going to have to,
you know, we're probably going to be able to pay
even our parents' bills.
Hopefully.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think we're going to be on the table.
Thank you guys so much.
But I think it also goes back to the question
about where why did we choose a hunger strike?
It's kind of like, you know,
we know that our grants are going to suffer from this.
And we're not going to graduate with a great GPA,
you know, as we could have.
And I mean, it's to show that, I mean,
we know that we're capable of doing a work.
But we feel so strongly about this that we're willing
to do a little bit, you know,
worse than everybody else,
because our issues are so important.
I mean, I think,
I don't know if the administration sees that,
but I don't know if anybody sees that.
But I mean, you know,
I know that I could be a nice student, you know,
but I choose to better be like,
to be a human being first,
and to care more about my people than about my grades.
I also asked you to relate it to the incident
that happened on Sunday,
that at the, at the, at the, at the film.
No, there's a film.
How do you, how do you feel,
or what steps can the university take,
to educate the student,
the sort of community in the Stanford faculty
about the ratio of, you know,
ongoing racism,
but the ratio of,
or why it is important to have a benefit
on this campus.
How do you think the university could take up
for active role in educating the community?
I think if,
if they really,
truly believe that that isn't right,
that the incident at Flicks isn't right
or that people should know
and should,
be the,
I mean,
understand that the pesticides
and the harm that they're doing to people is wrong,
then they should take it upon themselves to educate the students.
If they really feel responsible for the education of their students,
if they really,
if they believe that that is an important issue
that people's lives and people's health
and the reaction of some,
of some or a lot of students,
finding that amusing.
There's something wrong with that.
There's something wrong with an mentality
or with an ignorance level
or something of the students at this university.
And they are responsible
because they're,
they're administrative.
They're in charge of this school.
They're here to serve the students
and but they're also here to help educate them.
And there's,
I mean, to me that proved just a lot of ignorance.
It didn't surprise me,
but it was very offensive and it was very disrespectful.
And if they agree with that at all,
then it's their responsibility to deal with it.
I mean, the main things that were,
you know,
just to bring up what we're striking about,
you know,
we have these issues that we have been dealing with
as a community for a long time.
And, you know,
one of them being
our campus bound on grapes.
The development of a
to government studies program.
And the community center in East Palo Alto.
And, you know,
the third things that we can talk about,
specifically.
And the offer,
the university level,
and the offer for a high level position.
First of all,
we're going to have a high level of administrator here.
To come in the district.
Why is it important to
to the University to recognize
the CES contributions
to why why CES positions the CES role
included among these other things?
Well, basically because it ties down to the whole approach
that we're taking that our education is
and addressing the real issues.
You know,
the issues being poverty,
the joblessness,
and, you know,
the overrepresentation we have in the
jail isn't just everything.
And she ties into that
because Cecilia has always worked
for those issues.
She's always, you know,
she was working on the boycott grapes campaign.
And I mean,
and when she gets here,
I mean, when she's here,
you get here and she,
she's like a role mother.
No, no.
She's a role mother.
She's a role mother.
Oh, well,
let you have to get it tired.
Oh, no,
yeah, well,
we're trying to press that.
No,
she's a role mother.
She had a figure mother.
That's it.
No, I guess,
basically because she helps
and just keeping us here
because it's hard to survive
in a campus like this.
When you have people,
like Sunday nights at Flick St.
Beeners go home or,
you know,
saying stuff like that here at Stanford.
I mean,
how are we supposed to survive
in a kind of,
that doesn't even accept us.
You have to justify your existence.
And you need people like Cecilia Wustyaga
and like Francis that just,
help you out just to make,
like especially the transition from
like your first year,
I mean,
that's why helped me so much
living in Zapata,
my very first year is,
you know,
I survived the whole year
because I was living there,
I think,
because I mean,
she helped that alive
like with my parents
and just everything,
I mean,
I think,
like,
they're always carrying.
She's an important,
important contact for us.
I mean,
they're so,
so few of us here.
And then,
there's so few of our,
you know,
she got known,
she got in the role models here
that we can,
you know,
talk to and say,
hey, you know,
this happened to me today
or, you know,
I really,
it's really strange for me to be here
and not be back home,
where I see a lot of people who look like myself.
You know,
and these are people that you can talk to.
Like Cecilia,
you know,
she's,
I mean,
I find it incredible.
She's always has time to hear us out.
Yeah.
Always.
Yeah.
When,
when I was a freshman,
like,
I, I really,
nice story,
but that,
um,
when I,
well,
I didn't,
for some dumb chance,
I didn't get to live in sapata
my freshman year.
And so,
so,
like,
I had a lot of problems,
I just trying to adapt
and trying to,
trying to decide like,
what I was going to do with my life
and I had this whole big problem about
doing,
whether it to be a doctor,
I secure a good financial future
for myself and for my family,
or do what I really want to do,
is to be a teacher.
And,
um,
um,
my,
my freshman advisor,
recommended that I go to her,
because he had heard so many nice things about her,
and he thought she could help me.
And I remember going into her office
and just, like,
crying,
my gut's out,
because I didn't know what,
I didn't know where I fit into this university.
And, um,
she taught,
like,
she,
she sat with me in her office
and talked to me
and encouraged me to do what
what I felt was right,
you know,
to let my heart decide.
And,
I mean,
for the university,
not to recognize that she is capable of,
like, keeping me here,
because I was ready to leave.
And,
she literally made me,
helped me to stay.
And,
if it wasn't for her,
I mean,
all of your members have mentioned,
well,
we've met just what I'm thinking,
she got on this long history.
What, what,
what is,
um,
the significance of this new phase,
and,
and I'm the first to submit you to,
to the various,
uh,
the events that started,
uh,
UCLA,
UC,
San Barbara,
Colorado,
University of Colorado,
and Michigan State,
Virginia,
and Virginia.
You talk about this,
and the context of the overall,
research of,
and she comes to activism.
Um,
I think, as much,
um,
the Chicano Story Movement,
and there's a long history back there,
and they're,
they're going back to the original planet,
by the Santa Barbara.
And I think that each of us,
has,
um,
maintained that,
that,
that,
that goal of the,
the,
the,
the,
and,
um,
is very strong,
and we support,
with those founding,
um,
machistas,
um,
came up with,
in terms of,
with,
the Santa Barbara,
and, um,
it's,
it's,
and UCLA,
and UC Santa Barbara,
another universities,
met,
metcha members,
and other,
um,
organizations,
are taking leadership,
and,
moving the universities,
to meet the demands.
I think it's kind of an instrument to roll.
They got miscoded.
Are they in support?
Yeah.
We're rolling.
So what happened?
We're in a print,
they're in a print.
That sucks.
Okay.
I feel bad for mine.
But it's easy.
Oh yeah.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I was going to ask you,
I know,
earlier,
I talked to,
you know,
you're there.
Yeah.
I talked to your mom.
And I know from them that,
that it's really quite for them,
I mean, they haven't been eating as one.
They're also,
you know,
way also in the hundreds of interviews.
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
Roll with this?
How are you going to explain to your parents?
What's this already?
How do you really explain to them?
What's your favorite?
What's your favorite?
What's your favorite?
When I,
well, I told my,
my biggest worry,
in terms of deciding,
I didn't think part of the fast was
how my mom was going to take it.
Because I thought she was going to,
you know,
she's an asmatic and I thought she was going to get sick.
Because anytime she stresses out,
she has really bad attacks and stuff.
And I just,
I just knew I was going to worry her,
and I was going to hurt her,
and that was the thing that scared me the most.
But I talked to her about it,
and I kind of eased her into it.
I started telling her first about the plan
to stay out of the quarantine stuff.
And then she was like,
why don't she told me?
Before I even mentioned her that I was going to
and the fact she said,
well,
when you are leading,
when you are a leader,
and you are going to take part in changing things when they're bad.
Sometimes you have to make sacrifices.
She said,
and you know,
whatever happened,
you guys,
you know,
you have my parents,
and you have my support.
And so then when I told her,
she was like,
oh,
and I guess she maybe understood or was getting,
you know,
thought that I was going to get to that.
Because I told her,
she was like, well,
she said,
I'm not going to tell you to do it,
and I'm not going to tell you not to do it.
Because I don't want,
because maybe it didn't succeed,
or because you weren't,
you know,
you don't really don't want to do what you wanted to.
She said,
but I'm really scared,
but she said that she had faith in God,
and as long as I had faith in God,
that everything was going to be okay.
And so for me,
it was very empowering.
Because the minute I got off the phone,
I decided,
this is,
I really felt strongly about it already,
and I decided that this was something I was going to do.
And even though I wasn't going to cause her a lot of pain,
that I was going to get through it,
and she was going to get through it.
And I'm,
I'm pretty sure that she hasn't been eating either.
And I haven't been able to speak with her,
since that last time I talked to her.
But,
but like she told me,
she said,
you know,
she said,
for herself that she's already passed her using.
She doesn't know that she can do that much anymore.
And she said,
it's our turn.
And so,
here we are,
we're trying to make changes,
because I don't want to,
I really don't want my little brother to have to do something like this.
And I have a younger sister who's here also,
and I don't want her to have to,
you know, continue this.
I mean,
she probably won't have to,
just because that's the way things are around here.
But, you know,
if I can help out in some ways,
so that,
you know, the kids that come here later,
don't have to be going through this,
and that would be awesome.
So, yeah.
I don't want to question how,
as a university.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
And I guess,
that was a hardest thing for me,
as well as like,
I knew,
when we thought of the idea,
I knew that I wanted to do it.
I wanted to be part of the hunger strike.
I just knew that I could do it,
and I was going to have,
the world power to go through with it.
But,
the only thing was my mom.
I didn't know how to tell her.
I didn't know what to tell her.
I was scared,
because I know that.
The way my mom is,
she worries,
and she doesn't sleep then I,
and she can eat,
and it's just,
it's bad.
I hate it.
I don't like doing that to her,
because she still works,
and she's getting older,
and everything.
But,
I don't know,
it's just something I felt so,
so deep from my heart.
I just,
you know,
so many people are going to gain a lot from this.
So many people are going to,
you know,
have a lot of things come out of this,
especially like with the East Bengal
or the community center,
and with the boycott on the graves.
It's just,
immediate,
like, help for,
for people that are practically,
that are dying,
and, you know,
being born with their birthday fix.
So,
when I told her,
you know,
she was telling me,
you know,
she didn't want me to do it.
She was telling me,
I'm an email,
that I was an email,
and my dad told me I had a low red blood cell cow.
And there's just going to be no fatalities,
things that I had,
that I shouldn't be doing it,
because I was so skinny,
and I was going to disappear
and this and that.
So then,
I'm sorry.
So then,
after,
oh,
when I told her,
I mean,
it was really hard.
She was crying and everything.
And then,
I called her,
after the first day of the hunger strike.
And she couldn't talk to me
because she didn't want to cry on the phone.
So that,
that was just made me,
I was just crying.
I was sucking to my sister,
and my sister,
you know,
I was telling her,
tell my mom that I'm not hungry,
tell her that I'm feeling good.
She was,
she was,
keep me alive,
and I'm going to be okay.
So I'm,
but she's going to come today,
because she's,
she's worried,
and she also seems.
Well,
the hardest part of this whole thing was,
just to,
to tell my mom and dad,
you know,
that I was going to do this,
because like we've all said,
you know,
we don't want to make them suffer.
But I,
I told her,
and she said,
you know,
okay,
well,
okay,
like a few minutes before I left,
I was talking to her,
maybe,
so I don't know,
I'm going to have to translate that,
okay,
and then,
and then,
so,
you know,
she was crying,
and I could tell,
and she was giving me the blessing,
and so she was like,
you know what,
I'm going to be out there tomorrow,
and stuff,
you know,
my mom and dad got so many together,
and so my mom could fly out here and stuff,
and so she came out last night,
and I mean,
I think it was better for her to come,
because she,
she was upset when she saw me,
she was crying and stuff,
but, you know,
she's been really good,
and everybody's been really supportive of her,
and she's been,
I think it makes her feel good to feel useful,
to this,
to this thing,
she feels a part of this strike,
and, you know,
she feels a part of the movement,
you know,
I think that, you know,
she is,
because, you know,
that's what fighting for her and for everybody,
and, you know,
she slept out there with us last night,
so,
she's hardcore.
For me,
that,
that was definitely the hardest part,
because,
and after I did it,
I wish that I didn't,
that I didn't have to,
but I know that I,
that if I hadn't,
it would have been worse for her,
if she had found out some other way,
so,
I'm just really worried about it,
because she has heart problems,
I was afraid that if she saw me on the news,
or something,
you know,
she didn't even,
but that,
she, you know,
everything would be worse,
but, you know,
she's fine,
and,
and she already told me that she supports me,
and,
and even though it's the,
the hardest thing,
you know,
she,
I told her that it was her who taught me how to fight,
and,
maybe that,
hopefully that made her feel a little bit better,
but,
maybe,
I don't know,
I don't know exactly how she is,
I last time I talked to her,
she sounded very weak,
and,
my dad called me,
like the next morning after I told my mom,
and he tried as hard as to convince me not to do,
and he told me all kinds of things,
and he told me,
why do you want to,
why do you want to go through another hunger after you've suffered so many hungers in your life,
and,
just reminding me of all the things that I've had to go through,
just get where I am,
and try to tell me what don't,
you know, don't do it,
but,
I still did it,
and he's here right now,
and he came and told me,
he's still trying to convince me to stop,
because he goes,
he says,
you know,
your mom's going to come up here tomorrow,
and,
if you're still on the strike,
she's going to strike with you,
so,
I don't know.
Well,
I think generally,
my parents,
have the same feelings as,
oh,
they wish to,
but it's a little bit easier for them to handle,
because tonight's going to be the last day,
the first day,
so,
it's basically,
the last word,
you know?
Um,
well,
okay,
you say it's for historical purposes, right?
So, when,
you know,
20 years for now,
when other chickens look at this,
you know,
and chickens,
you know,
sorry,
you know,
one other,
and they see this,
um,
just to remember that,
you know,
even when you're looking at this now,
20 years later,
the movement is still alive in you,
and we still have to keep struggling,
because,
you know,
you will hopefully,
we can stop.
Hopefully, we can stop some of it,
but I mean,
if it's still,
it's still bad,
you know,
putting it in now,
you know,
we can do it, you know,
and don't take advantage of what,
you know,
what you have,
I guess like,
like,
for us,
we have,
we have a centron,
there's a lot of people I work hard for.
Don't settle for what you've done.
Don't settle for what you have.
And don't forget us pretty much,
don't forget the people who fought before you.
All the things,
the people that fought before us,
and before us,
and before them,
and just,
remember,
you know,
we're doing this for you,
for the future.
We're doing this for you,
for the future.
We're doing this for you,
for the future.
We're doing this for you,
for the future.
It is currently about 730 on the 6th of May,
Friday,
um,
1994.
We have just,
uh,
collected,
uh,
witnessed,
the five testimonials from,
uh,
five of the,
of the hunger strikers,
which have included,
um,
at one point,
over 100 solidarity strikers,
um,
at this time,
we received the latest response from the administration,
um,
uh,
I understand that there's still many points that need to be go,
need to be reviewed,
and,
uh,
some more dialogue that needs to be,
that needs to take place,
but at the moment,
it looks as though,
statement that,
that,
that we have made as a community,
that you got a community,
and the statement that comes from various communities,
throughout the Bay Area and the nation,
and solidarity with us,
um,
has,
open,
are begun to open the administration's eyes,
to the justness of our calls and our demands,
um,
however,
um,
as I said,
there still is,
some more to be done.
For the moment,
it seems as though,
uh,
our first demand,
that is,
the,
the offering of a high level position to associate dean,
Cecilia Bucyaga,
is still not being met,
and,
uh,
as I said,
this is our first demand,
and it's very important to us,
some more negotiation has to,
uh,
go on with regards to that,
the second demand,
and,
involves the establishment of a community center,
and he's follow-alto,
to serve the community that literally works,
to preserve the functioning of this university,
and,
as,
as,
as far as the universities,
the administration,
it's concerned,
they are receptive to the initiative,
that the Chicano students,
the Chicano students have presented,
in terms of bridging the gap between the community,
and the academy.
Um,
uh,
this has,
has been very important,
component to the struggle here,
uh,
as a matter of fact,
this is a component that isn't new.
It goes all the way back to the Blondis Antavarra,
which,
uh,
inaugurated metro.
Uh,
so we're,
we are very hopeful that some,
some breakthrough will come through here.
As regards to Chicano and Chicano studies,
um,
again,
this is,
uh,
the justness,
and the feasibility of this demand,
um,
has led the administration to also,
give overtures that,
um,
uh,
are encouraging.
Finally,
the issue of,
of great-blown campus,
um,
have,
and specifically,
the negative,
the racist reactions to our efforts to,
to educate the community at Stanford,
has,
uh,
uh,
and our protest against those negative reactions,
um,
has,
uh,
led the university to embark upon an initiative,
um,
to educate all the dorms through the show,
and of the no-greats video,
and,
uh,
and also through, through,
um,
it's, uh,
establishing a dialogue with our community,
that Chicano community,
uh,
an effort to bridge the gaps that have been,
uh,
uh,
uh,
call,
uh,
bridge the,
the divisions that have been caused,
uh,
uh,
the racism that's very often in Brazil,
uh,
uh,
an academy,
uh,
which is very,
uh,
uh,
uh,
which is very,
uh,
uh,
uh,
which is very,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
