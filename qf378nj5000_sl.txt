My name is Elvira Fioto. I'm a sophomore in human biology here.
I'm from Reedley, California, which is a small agricultural town in the San Joaquin Valley.
My parents are migrant workers and I've worked in the fields with them all my life up until I started coming to school.
My name is Eva Silva. I'm a senior majoring in human biology with an emphasis on education in the diverse classroom.
And I'm from Salinas, California, and I'm going to be a math teacher.
My name is Tamara Alvarado and I'm majoring in Spanish Chicano Studies.
I'm from a town in San Diego called Escondido.
And what else? That's it for now.
My name is Julia Gonzalez Luna. I'm a senior majoring in public policy with a focus on education.
And I'm from Burbank, California, and I'm going to be a social studies high school teacher.
Do you want to ask some questions here as to how this started?
In your own words, how did it start? How did this hunger strike start and why?
How did it start?
Speak to us as if we don't know.
Okay.
Well, I guess it was a buildup of a lot of different things that have been happening, not only on this campus,
but overall in this nation with the status of Chicanos and Chicanas in the United States, in the universities, and everywhere else.
So, you know, I guess I can run down like since my freshman year so many things have happened,
closing down the Office of Chicano Affairs, and then with all the threats, with the budget cuts to the ethnic centers,
and just these attacks on the theme houses on the ethnic centers and everything else,
and then the laying off of Cecilia Burciaga.
I mean, everything just piled down, piled down, and so many things were happening that we said,
wait, we need to do something about it and we need to change what's going on
because nothing's happening that we want to happen.
I'm tired. I'm so tired.
Some people wonder why you would need to take a drastic measure like this.
Some people say, why do you need to?
Because the administration has been very...
Whenever we've had like meetings and townhouse meetings or whatever,
any of the administrators, we don't get any results that we're happy with.
And so it seemed to me like for them to really understand how extreme the situation is on this campus
and how extreme things are outside in terms of immigrant bashing
and just the way that people in Ispa Lo Alto are,
that it was maybe the only way that they would...
I don't know if it would touch their hearts or if they would just stop to think about it
or if we could get enough bad press for this university so that they could finally just really think about it
because otherwise they weren't paying attention.
It was just like everything had to go business as usual
and there seemed to be this idea about hierarchy here that it was from top down.
It was what they said first and then if we could deal with that,
if we as students could deal with what the university wanted, well then that was fine.
And if we couldn't, that's too bad because they're at their position because they earned it or whatever.
Yeah, because meeting after meeting,
you didn't get anything concrete from meeting with them every single time.
It was just, okay, I'll give you a meeting from 6 to 7, I'll give you a meeting from 5, 5.30 to 6 or whatever.
We've tried their methods.
We've tried their methods of working things out
and their methods are to draw things out for as long as possible
in order to not give us things.
They may say it differently but that's what it feels like
and it's ridiculous to have to spend,
I'm sorry I'm slow but I'm a little bit tired,
it's ridiculous to spend so much time just talking and talking about things
and they're trying to tire us out with just talking.
So that's what it had to come to.
When people are not heard, and this happens in society at large,
when people are not heard,
I don't know if I want to say abnormal behaviors
but behaviors that are not normal,
behaviors that are not normal are what happen
and yeah, this is not normal.
This is not normal behavior for us to be not eating.
I really like to eat.
Yeah, we like to eat.
I emphasize, why are chicanos in prison?
Why are chicanos in poverty?
That's not normal.
That's not normal for people.
But because of society, that's how we are.
We've waited long enough for this.
I know the administration is probably thinking,
well, be patient and these changes will happen
but we've been patient long enough
The Chicano Studies major was envisioned back in the 70s,
even the 60s, and we've been waiting since then.
It's about time that we get recognized.
Chicanos are the biggest, are coming to be a majority in California
and maybe even in the whole country after a while.
It's about time that our issues get recognized
and that other people just realize that we're not going to go away
and if they don't educate themselves about us,
then it's just going to be worse for them.
Well, you co-authored a really beautiful poem
entitled Somos Mujeres.
What, for you, is the significance of having four chicanos
taking the vanguard role in this movement,
which is really bigger than this campus?
For me, I mean, I don't know.
We didn't really realize it was four women
until somebody pointed it out to us.
I mean, we knew it was girls, but we didn't see it like,
oh, there's no guys here, what's up with the guys?
I don't know.
I mean, we have a lot of supporters that are male
and maybe they didn't say they were going to go for the long run,
but they've been there the whole time.
Everybody has their roles,
and there's some people that are the negotiators,
there's people that are security over here.
Everybody has their roles, and we're not the most important
because if it wasn't for them,
then nobody would be listening to us or whatever.
And there's other people that have been fasting also,
like Felipe Serino-Barregan.
He's been fasting these three days with us as well,
and there's people that committed to three days
and there's others that do one-day cycles
to show their support and solidarity.
It's true, there are a lot of males
that are doing really important stuff
in terms of really trying, you know,
like with the rest of the women also,
trying to take care of us and trying to watch out for this,
and they're just constantly looking out to see what we need
or what needs to be done for the whole group.
And so it's, I don't know, I don't know that it's specifically
a female thing to be fasting or anything like that.
Because everybody really does have their own role,
and everybody's been really supportive
and we're working together.
It just so happened that we're the ones that,
you know, we're the ones that, you know,
we're ready mentally at this time to fast.
And, you know, it just so happens that we're all women.
Yeah, people are calling us guerrillas and revolucionales
and everything.
That's, I mean, that's fine.
That's nice, yeah, that's really nice.
But, I mean, everybody's been revolutionary.
And, you know, it comes down to...
The focus should be on everybody.
Yeah, it comes down to, like, what you're, you know,
I don't want to say your talents,
because I don't think our talent is to be hungry, but...
But pretty much, like, everybody has taken on the role
that is best suited for themselves.
There's Felipe.
You know, of all the things that you could have done,
of all the actions you could have taken, why fasting?
Why did you choose to fast?
Well, it's obviously a really strong statement.
You know, it's something that...
It's uncompromising.
And it's something that shows just how serious we are
about these issues.
They're issues that our fathers, grandfathers,
and people way before us have fought for.
And we have a responsibility to those ancestors of ours
to make sure that those dreams that they had,
that vision they had, is fulfilled.
We can't just, you know...
It may be 20 years, 20, 30, 20 years later,
from the Chicano movement that people think is dead,
but it's not dead.
We're here and we're living, and we're the Chicano movement.
The Chicano movement.
Yeah.
Chicano movement.
Felipe, you just joined us, but actually,
you've been with us throughout this whole struggle
from the beginning, as was pointed out.
Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, where you're from,
and your reflections on this struggle?
Sure.
My name is Felipe Barag√°n.
I'm a freshman, originally from Los Angeles, California.
This struggle, I think, for me,
it's something that's very important,
because I went to high school in Watts,
and a lot of people know what Watts is like,
1965, Watts Rebellion, the 92 riots.
There I saw issues that the educational system
for high school students in Chicano,
Latinos there, wasn't addressing the real issues.
Once I came here, I got a taste of it,
I got a taste of Chicano studies,
and I found out how crucial that was.
And I think that getting involved with the struggle
is important for me to build the processes
with which we learn to deal with inner city,
to wipe out the marginalization of our people.
In terms of your actions,
a lot of people are probably thinking
that you came here to study,
and that you should be in the classroom,
not protesting.
So you're making a decision,
because it is a pretty tough university to be at,
and there's a lot of demands,
and you're kind of out there really taking a big chance.
How did you make that decision?
See, I guess the main thing is,
I never, when I came here,
I didn't want to come and just study,
and go to class, and go back home,
study, do my work, and just concentrate on myself.
While there's people out there,
there's students in the high schools
that are getting pushed out of the schools,
there's the farm workers that are getting treated badly,
there's kids being born without hands
because of the pesticides that they put on the grapes.
I mean, I can't just sit and concentrate on my own work
and not worry about what's going on,
because that's my people, that's my parents,
that's my family, that's everybody.
And I wouldn't be able to live with myself
without doing anything about it.
I wouldn't be able to live with myself
and my career, and getting straight A's,
and doing my resumes, and stuff like that.
I wouldn't be able to do that.
I mean, both things can be done.
Also, I think that we're doing this
so that later generations of Stanford chicanos
and chicanas don't have to do it.
Today we had little chicanitas and chicanitos
from East Palo Alto come out
from a valet folklorico group called Raices de Mexico,
and they came out, and they came out and supported us.
They're just little kids.
I don't know.
They're probably from five to twelve, maybe.
And the reason we're doing this now
and sacrificing our academic times
or study hours or whatever,
so that when they come here,
they can focus on doing the things that they need to do
instead of having to struggle so much.
I mean, I think it's just like our parents.
They struggle so that we don't have to struggle.
And we're still struggling,
but at a different level, you know what I mean?
We don't have to worry.
Once we get out of here,
we're not going to have to worry about,
where am I going to get something to eat like before?
Or how are we going to pay the bills?
We're probably going to be able to pay
even our parents' bills.
I think it also goes back to the question about
why did we choose a hunger strike?
It's kind of like, you know,
we know that our grades are going to suffer from this,
and we're not going to graduate with a great GPA,
you know, as we could have.
I mean, it's to show that, I mean,
we know that we're capable of doing a work,
but we feel so strongly about this
that we're willing to do a little bit,
you know, worse than everybody else
because our issues are so important.
And I mean, I think,
I don't know if the administration sees that,
but I don't know if anybody sees that.
But I mean, you know,
I know that I could be a NA student, you know,
but, you know, I choose to better be like,
to be a human being first
and to care more about my people
than about my grades.
I was going to ask you,
related to the incident that happened on Sunday
at the Flix, the film, No Place to Show,
how do you feel,
or what steps can the university take
to educate the student community,
even staff and faculty,
about the issue of ongoing racism,
the issue of why it's important
to have abandoned graves on this campus?
How do you think the university
can take a proactive role
in educating the community?
I think if they really, truly believe
that that isn't right,
that the incident at Flix isn't right,
that people should know and should,
I mean, understand that the pesticides
and the harm that they're doing to people is wrong,
then they should take it upon themselves
to educate this university.
If they really feel responsible
for the education of their students,
if they really, if they believe
that that is an important issue,
that people's lives and people's health
and the reaction of some or a lot of students
finding that amusing,
there's something wrong with that.
There's something wrong with the mentality
or with the ignorance level
of the students of this university,
and they are responsible
because they're the administrators.
They're in charge of this school.
They're here to serve students,
but they're also here to help educate them.
And there's, I mean, to me,
that proved just a lot of ignorance.
It didn't surprise me,
but it was very offensive
and it was very disrespectful.
And if they really, if they agree with that at all,
then it's their responsibility to deal with it.
I mean, the main things that were,
you know, just to bring up
or striking about,
you know, we have these issues
that we have been dealing with
as a community for a long time.
And, you know, one of them being
a campus ban on grapes,
the development of a Chicano studies program,
and the community center in East Palo Alto.
And, you know, these are things
that we can talk about specifically.
And the offer for Cecilia Bulsierga.
And the offer for a high-level position
for Cecilia Bulsierga,
a high-level administrator here,
Chicano administrator.
Why is it important for the university
to recognize Cecilia's contributions?
Why is Cecilia's position, Cecilia's role
in this role included among these other three?
Well, basically because it ties down
to the whole approach that we're taking
that our education is in addressing the real issues.
You know, the issues being poverty,
the joblessness, and, you know,
the over-representation we have in the jails,
and just everything.
And she ties into that
because Cecilia has always worked,
you know, for those issues.
She's always, you know,
she was working on the Boycott Grapes campaign.
And, I mean, when she gets here,
I mean, when she's here, you get here.
I mean, she's like a role model.
A role model.
What is this?
A role model.
Oh, man, I'm getting tired.
Oh, no.
Yeah, what we're talking about is she's a role model
and a role mother.
Mother figure.
Mother figure.
That's it.
Now, I guess basically because she helps
in just keeping us here
because it's hard to survive in a campus like this
when you have people, like, Sunday nights at Flick saying,
beaners go home or, you know,
saying stuff like that here at Stanford.
I mean, how are we supposed to survive in a climate
that doesn't even accept us,
that you have to justify your existence?
And you need people like Cecilia Bustiaga
and, like, Francis that just help you out
just to make, like, especially the transition
from, like, your first year.
I mean, that's what helped me so much,
living in Zapata my very first year is,
you know, I survived the whole year
because I was living there, I think,
because, I mean, she helped out a lot,
like, with my parents and just everything.
I mean, I think, like, they're always caring for you.
She's an important contact for us.
I mean, there's so few of us here,
and then there's so few of our, you know,
Chicano and Chicana role models here
that we can, you know, talk to and say, you know,
hey, you know, this happened to me today,
or, you know, I really, it's really strange
for me to be here and not be back home
where I see a lot of people who look like myself,
you know, and these are people
that you can talk to, like Cecilia.
You know, she's, I mean, I find it incredible.
She always has time to hear us out, always.
Yeah, when I was a freshman,
like, I have a really nice story about her
that when I, well, I didn't,
for some dumb chance,
I didn't get to live in Zapata my freshman year,
and so, so, like, I had a lot of problems,
like, just trying to adapt and trying to,
trying to decide, like, what I was going to do with my life,
and I had this whole big problem about deciding
whether to be a doctor and secure a good financial future
for myself and for my family
or do what I really wanted to do,
and I was supposed to be a teacher,
and my freshman advisor recommended that I go to her
because he had heard so many nice things about her
that he thought she could help me,
and I remember going into her office
and just, like, crying my guts out
because I didn't know what,
I didn't know where I fit into this university,
and she had time, like, she sat with me in her office
and talked to me and encouraged me
to do what I felt was right, you know,
to let my heart decide,
and, I mean, for the university not to recognize
that she is capable of, like, keeping me here
because I was ready to leave,
and she literally helped me to stay,
and if it wasn't for her, I mean, I wouldn't be here.
All of you are members of METCHA,
a mental student in Chicano that has a long history.
What is the significance of this new phase,
and I'm referring specifically to the various events
that started UCLA, UC, Santa Barbara, Colorado,
University of Colorado, and Michigan State?
Virginia, too.
And Virginia, too.
You talk about this in the context of the overall resurgence
of METCHA and Chicano student activism.
I think as METCHA is the Chicano student movement,
and there's a long history of activism there,
dating back to the original plan of Santa Barbara,
and I think that each of us has maintained
that goal of the betterment of La Raza,
and our METCHA is very strong,
and we support what those founding Mechistas
came up with in terms of the plan of Santa Barbara,
and in UCLA and UC Santa Barbara and other universities,
METCHA members and other organizations
are taking the leadership and moving the universities
to meet the demands.
I think it's playing an instrumental role.
They got misquoted?
Are they in support?
So what happened?
That sucks, man.
I feel bad for my nephew.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry.
I was going to ask you.
Earlier I talked to your dad.
I talked to your mom.
I know from them that it's been really hard for them.
I mean, they haven't been eating as well.
They're also, in a way, also in the hunger strike.
How do you feel about your parents' role in this?
How are you going to explain to your parents
once it's already been explained to them?
What kind of courage have you gotten from your parents?
My biggest worry in terms of deciding to take part in the fast
was how my mom was going to take it,
because I thought she was going to get...
she's an asthmatic and I thought she was going to get sick
because any time she stresses out,
she has really bad attacks and stuff,
and I just knew I was going to worry her
and I was going to hurt her,
and that was the thing that scared me the most.
But I talked to her about it,
and I kind of eased her into it.
I started telling her first about the plan
before I even mentioned to her that I was going to fast.
She said, well, Mihael, when you are a leader
and you want to take part in changing things when they're bad,
sometimes you have to make sacrifices.
She said, and whatever happens,
you have my prayers and you have my support.
And so then when I told her, she was like,
and I guess she maybe understood
or thought that I was going to get to that,
because I told her and she was like,
well, I'm not going to tell you to do it
and I'm not going to tell you not to do it,
but I want to feel responsible for you doing it
and I don't want to feel responsible for you feeling bad
because maybe it didn't succeed
or because you really didn't want to do what you wanted to.
She said, but I'm really scared,
but she said that she had faith in God
and as long as I had faith in God,
that everything was going to be okay.
And so for me, it was very empowering,
because the minute I got off the phone,
I really felt strongly about it already,
and I decided that this was something I was going to do.
And even though I was going to cause her a lot of pain,
that I was going to get through it
and that she was going to get through it.
And I'm pretty sure that she hasn't been eating either
and I haven't been able to speak with her
since that last time I talked to her.
But like she told me,
she said for herself
that she's already passed her youth
and she doesn't know that she can do that much anymore
and she said, it's our turn.
And so here we are,
we're trying to make changes,
because I really don't want my little brother
to go through something like this.
And I have a younger sister who's here also
and I don't want her to have to continue this.
I mean, she probably won't have to,
just because that's the way things are around here.
But if I can help out in some way
so that the kids that come here later
don't have to be going through this,
then that would be awesome.
So, yeah.
I have a question. How has the university administration...
Okay.
I guess that was the hardest thing for me as well.
I knew, like when we thought of the idea,
I knew that I wanted to do it.
I wanted to be part of the hunger strike.
I just knew that I could do it
and I was going to have
the willpower to go through with it.
But the only thing was my mom.
I didn't know how to tell her.
I didn't know what to tell her.
I was scared.
Because I know that the way my mom is,
she worries and she doesn't sleep at night
and she can't eat.
And it's just bad.
I hate it.
I don't like doing that to her
because she still works
and she's getting older and everything.
But I don't know.
It's just something I felt so deep from my heart.
I just thought, you know,
I'm not going to stop from this.
So many people are going to
have a lot of things come out of this.
Especially with the Ispa Loto Community Center
and with the boycott on the graves.
It's just immediate help
for people that are dying
and being born with their birth defects.
So when I told her,
she was telling me
she didn't want me to do it.
That I was anemic.
That my dad told me I had a low red blood cell count.
They were just coming up with all these things
that I had that I shouldn't be doing
because I was so skinny
and I was going to disappear and this and that.
When I told her,
it was really hard because she was crying
and then I called her
after the first day of the hunger strike
and she couldn't talk to me
because she didn't want to cry on the phone.
So that just made me,
I was just crying, I was talking to my sister
and my sister was, you know,
I was telling her, tell my mom that I'm not hungry.
Tell her that I'm feeling good.
The issues are keeping me alive
and they're going to keep me alive
and I'm going to be okay.
But she's going to come today
because she's worried and she wants to see me.
Well, the hardest part of this whole thing
was just to tell my mom and dad
that I was going to do this
because like we've all said,
we don't want to make them suffer.
But I told her and she said,
okay, well if you guys are still out there
after three days then I'm going to come out.
And then a few minutes before I left,
I was talking to her
and she was giving me the blessing
Do I have to translate that?
Oh, okay.
And then, so you know,
she was crying and I could tell
and she was giving me the blessing
and so she was like, you know what,
I'm going to be out there tomorrow
and stuff and you know,
my mom and dad got some money together
so my mom could fly out here and stuff
and so she came out last night.
I mean, I think it was better for her to come
because she was upset when she saw me
and she was crying and stuff
but she's been really good
and everybody's been really supportive of her
and I think it makes her feel good
to feel useful to this thing.
She feels a part of this strike
and she feels a part of the movement
and I think that she is
because we're fighting for her
and for everybody
and she slept out there with us last night.
So, she's hardcore.
For me, that was definitely the hardest part
and after I did it,
I wish that I didn't have to
but I know that if I hadn't,
it would have been worse for her
if she had found out some other way
so I'm just really worried about it
because she has heart problems
and I was afraid that if she saw me
on the news or something,
we would have been in everything
but she's fine
and she already told me
that she supports me
and even though it's the hardest thing for her,
I told her that it was her
who taught me how to fight
and hopefully that made her feel a little bit better
but hopefully, I don't know,
exactly how she is.
The last time I talked to her,
she sounded very weak
and my dad called me
the morning after I told my mom
and he tried his hardest
to convince me not to do it.
He told me all kinds of things
and he told me,
why do you want to go through another hunger
after you've suffered so many hungers in your life?
Just reminding me of all the things
that I've had to go through
just to get where I am
and he told me, don't do it
but I still did it
and he's here right now
and he came and told me
he's still trying to convince me to stop
because he says,
your mom's going to come up here tomorrow
and if you're still on the strike,
she's going to strike with you.
I think generally,
my parents have the same feelings
as all of the others do
but it's a little bit easier for them to handle
because it's my last day fasting.
That's basically it.
Last word?
You said it's for historical purposes, right?
So when,
20 years from now
when other Chicanas look at this
and Chicanas,
sorry,
tired,
when other people see this,
just to remember that
even when you're looking at this now,
20 years later,
the movement is still alive in you
and we still have to keep struggling
because...
Hopefully we can stop.
Hopefully we can stop some of it
but if it's still bad
20 years from now,
we can do it.
And don't take advantage
of what you have.
I guess for us,
it's very important to say,
we have El Centro
and there's a lot of people that work hard for it.
Don't settle for what you have.
And don't forget us, pretty much.
Don't forget the people who fought before you.
All the things like the people that fought before us
and before them
and just
remember we're doing this
for you, for the future.
For the youth!
Thank you.
It is currently about 7.30 on the 6th of May, Friday, 1994.
We have just collected,
witnessed
the five testimonials from
five of the hunger strikers
which have included
at one point
over 100 solidarity strikers.
At this time, we've received the latest response
from the administration
which has been recalcitrant up to this point
and I understand
that there's still many points that need to be reviewed
and some more dialogue
that needs to take place
but at the moment,
it looks as though
a statement that
we have made as a community,
the Chicano community,
and a statement that comes from
various communities
throughout the Bay Area and the nation
in solidarity with us
has
begun to open the administration's eyes
to the justness of our cause
and our demands.
However, as I said,
there still is
some work to be done.
For the moment,
it seems as though
our first demand,
that is the offering
of a high level position to
Associate Dean Cecilia Burciaga,
is still not being met
and as I said,
this is our first demand
and it's very important to us.
Some more negotiation has to
go on with regards to that.
The second demand
involves the establishment of a community center
in East Palo Alto
to serve the community
that literally works
to preserve the functioning of this university
and as
as
as
far as the university's administrate
the administration
is concerned,
they are receptive to the initiative
that the Chicano students, the Chicano and Chicana students
have presented in terms of
bridging the gap between the community
and the academy.
This has been
a very important component to
the struggle here.
As a matter of fact, this is a component
that isn't new, it goes all the way back to the Plan de Santa Barbara
which
inaugurated
Mecha.
So we are very
hopeful that some breakthrough will come
through here. As regards to the Chicano
and Chicana studies, again
this is
the justness and the feasibility
of this demand
has led the administration to also
give overtures that
are encouraging.
Finally,
the issue of
grapes on campus
has, and specifically the
negative reactions, the racist
reactions to our efforts to educate
the community at Stanford has
and our
protests against those
negative reactions has
led the university to
embark upon an initiative
to educate all the dorms
through the showing of the No Grapes video
and also
through
establishing
a dialogue with our community, the Chicano community
in an effort
to bridge the gaps that have been
caused, bridge
the divisions that have been caused
by
the racism that's very often
a result of
an academy
which is very hierarchical and one
which is institutionally
structurally hostile to the presence
of minorities
and other marginalized people.
With this, I would just like to say
que viva la raza y adelante.
We're going to win this one.
Thank you.
