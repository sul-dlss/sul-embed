My name is Evira Fyato and I'm a sophomore in human biology here.
My name is Eva Silva and I'm a senior majoring in human biology with an emphasis on education and the diverse classroom and I'm from Salinas California and I'm going to be a math teacher.
My name is Tamara Alvarado and I'm majoring in Spanish Chicano Studies. I'm from a town in San Diego called Esconvido and for us. That's it for now.
My name is Julio Gonzales Luna. I'm a senior majoring in public policy with a focus on education and I'm from Burbank, California and I'm going to be a social studies high school teacher.
How did this hunger strike start and why?
How did it start?
I guess it was a buildup of a lot of different things that have been happening not only on this campus but overall in this nation with the status of Chicanos and Chicanas in the United States and the universities and everywhere else.
I guess I can run down like since my freshman year so many things have happened, the closing down of the office of Chicano Affairs and then with all the threats with the budget cuts to the ethnic centers and just these attacks on the theme houses on the ethnic centers and everything else and then the laying off of Ceci de la Borciaga.
Everything just like piled down piled down and so many things were happening that we said wait we need to do something about it and we need to change what's going on because nothing's happening that we want to happen.
I can't even wonder why you would need to take a drastic measure like this.
Because the administration has been very and whenever we've had meetings and townhouse meetings or wherever we get together with any of the administrators we don't get any results that we're happy with.
And so it seemed to me like for them to really understand how extreme the situation is on this campus and how extreme things are outside in terms of immigrant bashing.
And just the way that people in Isbalo Alto are that it was maybe the only way that they would I don't know if it would touch their heart or if they would just stop and think about it or if we could get enough that press with this university so that they could finally just really think about it.
Because otherwise they weren't paying attention to us just like everything had to go business as usual and there seemed to be this idea about hierarchy here that it was from top down.
It was what they said first and then if we could deal with that, if we students could deal with what the university wanted, well then that was fine.
And if we couldn't, that's too bad because they're at their position because they earned it or whatever.
Yeah, because meeting after meeting like you didn't get anything concrete from meeting with them every single time.
It was just, okay, I'll give you a meeting from 67. I'll give you a meeting of five, five, thirty to six or whatever.
And we've tried their methods of working things out and their methods are to draw things out for as long as possible in order to not give us things.
At least, they may say differently but that's what it feels like and it's ridiculous to have to spend, I'm sorry, I'm slow, but a little bit tired.
It's ridiculous to spend so much time just talking and talking about things and they're trying to tire us out with just talking.
So that's what it had to come to and when people are not heard and this happens in society at large when people are not heard.
I don't know if I want to say normal behaviors but behaviors that are not normal, behaviors that are not normal are what happen.
And yeah, this is not normal. This is not normal behavior for us to be not eating.
But, you know, I really like you.
Yeah, we like to eat.
And, you know, it just, I emphasize, you know, why are chicken most imprisoned? Why are chicken most, you know, in poverty? That's not normal. That's not normal for people.
But because of society, that's how we are.
We've waited long enough for this. I mean, I know the administration is probably thinking, well, you know, be patient and these changes will happen.
We've been patient long enough and, you know, the Chicano studies major has been, it was envisioned back in the 70s, even the 60s.
And we've been waiting since then and it's about time that we get recognized, you know, Chicanos are the biggest, are coming to be a majority in California and, you know, maybe even in the whole country after a while.
I mean, it's about time that our issues get recognized and that other people just, just realize that we're not going to go away.
And if they don't educate themselves about us, then it's just going to be worse for them.
Well, did you call out there to have a really beautiful appointment? I was almost in my head.
What, for you, is the significance of having what you got us taking the Vanguard role in this movement, which is really bigger than this campus?
For me, I mean...
I don't know. We didn't really realize it was for women until somebody pointed it out to us.
I mean, we knew it was girls, but we didn't see it like, you know, oh, you know, there's no guys here, you know, like, you know, what's up with the guys?
But, I don't know. I mean, we have a lot of supporters that are male and maybe they didn't say they're going to go for the long run, but they've been, you know, there the whole time.
Everybody has their roles, and there's some people that are the negotiators, there's people that are security over here.
Everybody has their roles, and we're not the most important, because if it wasn't for them, then nobody would be listening to us or whatever.
And there's other people that have been fasting also on, like, Felipe said, you know, but again, he's been fasting these three days with us as well, and like, there's people that committed to three days, and others that do one day cycles to show their support and solidarity.
It's true, there are a lot of males that are doing really important stuff in terms of really trying, you know, like, with the rest of the women also, trying to take care of us and trying to watch out for this,
and they're just constantly looking out to see what, you know, what we need or what needs to be done for the whole group.
And so it's, I don't know, I don't know that it's specifically a female thing to be fasting or anything like that.
Because I think, because everybody really does have their own role, and everybody's been really supportive and we're working together.
It just so happened that we were the ones that were the ones that, you know, were ready mentally at this time to fast, and you know, it just so happens that we're all women.
Yeah, people are kindness and guerrillas and revolutionaries and all that.
I mean, that's, that's, I mean, that's fine.
That's what lies, you know, it's really, that's really nice.
But I mean, everybody, everybody's been revolutionary.
And you know, it's, it comes down to, like, everything.
Yeah, it comes down to, like, what you, you know, I don't want to say your talent.
Because I don't think our talent is to be hungry, but everybody is taking on the role that, that is best suited for themselves.
There's Felipe.
There's Felipe.
All the things that you could have done, all the actions you could have taken, why fasting?
Why did you choose to fast?
Well, it's obviously a really strong statement.
You know, it's something that it's uncompromising, and it's something that shows just how serious we are about these issues.
They're issues that our fathers, grandfathers, and people way before us and, you know, have fought for them.
We have a responsibility to those ancestors of ours to make sure that those dreams that they had,
those, that vision they had, is fulfilled.
We can't just, you know, it may be 20 years, 20, 20, 20 years later, from the, you know, the Chicano movement that people think is dead.
But it's not dead. We're here and we're living and we're the Chicano movement.
And Chicano movement.
Yeah.
Chicano, Chicano.
Felipe, we just joined us.
But actually, you've been with us throughout this whole struggle from the beginning, as was pointed out.
You tell us a little bit about yourself, where you're from, and your reflection on this struggle.
Sure.
My name is Felipe Guarayan.
I'm a freshman originally from Los Angeles, California.
This struggle, I think, for me, it's something that's very important.
Because I went to high school in Watts.
And a lot of people know what Watts is like, 1965 Watts rebellion, the 90 riots.
There I saw issues that, that the educational system for high school students in Chicano, Latinos there, wasn't addressing the real issues.
Once I came here, I got a, I got a taste of it.
I got a taste of Chicano studies.
And I found out how crucial that was.
And I think that getting involved with the struggle is important for me to build the processes with which we learn to deal with intercity to wipe out the marginalization of our people.
In terms of your actions, a lot of people are probably thinking that you came here to study, and that you should be in the classroom, not protesting.
So you're making a decision, because it is a pretty tough university to be at.
There's a lot of demands, and you're kind of out there really taking a big chance.
How did you make that decision?
Yeah, I guess, like, the main thing is, is, like, I never, like, when I came here, I didn't want to come and just study and go to class and go back home, study, do my work, and just concentrate on myself.
While there's people out there, there's students in the high schools that are getting pushed out of the schools, there's, you know, the farm workers that are getting treated badly, there's kids being born with their hands because of the pesticides that they put on the grapes.
I mean, I can't just sit and concentrate on my own work and not worry about what's going on, because, you know, that's my people, that's my parents, that's my family, that's, you know, everybody.
And I wouldn't be able to live with myself without doing anything about it. I wouldn't be able to live with myself or just thinking about myself and my career and getting straight A's and doing my resumes and stuff like that.
I wouldn't be able to do that. I mean, both things can be done.
Yeah, also, like, I think that we're doing this so that, you know, later generations of Stanford, Chicanos and Chicanos don't have to do it.
Today, we had, you know, little Chicanitas and Chicanitos from East Palo Alto come out and from Avala Focularico called Draises in Mexico.
And they came out and they, you know, they came out and supported us. You know, they're just little kids. I don't know, they're probably like from five to like 12 maybe.
And, you know, the reason we're doing this now and sacrificing our academic times or study hours or whatever.
So that they, when they come here, you know, they can focus, you know, on doing the things that they need to do instead of having to struggle so much.
I mean, I think it's just like our parents, you know, they struggle so that we don't have to struggle. And we don't, I mean, we don't struggle.
We're still struggling, but at a different level, you know what I mean? We're not, I mean, we don't have to worry.
Once we get out of here, we're not going to have to worry about, where am I going to get something to eat like before?
Or how are we going to pay the bills? We're probably going to have to, you know, we're probably going to be able to pay even our parents bills.
Okay. Yeah.
I think we're going to be able to think about teachers.
But I think it also goes back to the question about where, why did we choose a hunger strike?
It's kind of like, you know, we know that our grades are going to suffer from this and we're not going to graduate with a great GPA, you know, as we could have.
And I mean, it's to show that, I mean, we know that we're capable of doing a work, but we feel so strongly about this that we're willing to do a little bit, you know, worse than everybody else because our issues are so important.
And I mean, I think, I don't know if the administration sees that, but I don't know if anybody sees that.
But I mean, you know, I know that I could be a nice student, you know, but, you know, I choose to a better be like, to be a human being first and to care more about my people than about my grades.
I was going to ask you related to the incident that happened on Sunday, that at the end of the flip and the film, no Thursday show.
How do you feel or what steps can the university take to educate the student community in a certain faculty about the ratio of ongoing racism, the issue of why it's important to have abandoned graves on this campus?
How do you think the university could take a proactive role in educating the community?
I think if they really truly believe that that isn't right, that the incident at Flicks isn't right, or that people should know and should be, I mean, understand that the pesticides and the harm that they're doing to people is wrong, then they should take it upon themselves to educate this university.
If they really feel responsible for the education of their students, if they really, if they believe that that is an important issue that people's lives and people's health and the reaction of some or a lot of students finding that I'm using, there's something wrong with that.
There's something wrong with an mentality or with an ignorance level or something of the students at this university and they are responsible because they're administrative, they're in charge of this school.
They're here to serve the students, but they're also here to help educate them.
And to me, that proved just a lot of ignorance. It didn't surprise me, but it was very offensive and it was very disrespectful.
And if they really, if they agree with that at all, then it's their responsibility to deal with it.
I mean, the main things that were, just to bring up what we're striking about,
you know, we have these issues that we have been dealing with as a community for a long time.
And, you know, one of them being a campus band on grapes, the development of a Chicago Studies program,
and the community center and the Spalolto.
And, you know, the certain things that we can talk about specifically.
And the offer, of course, a high level position.
Of course, it's a high level, a high level administrator here to come administrator.
Why is it important for the university to recognize the CDS contributions?
Why is the CDS positions the CDS role included among these other three?
Well, basically, because it ties down to the whole approach that we're taking that our education isn't addressing the real issues.
You know, the issues being poverty, the job, joblessness, and, you know, the overrepresentation we have in the jails and just everything.
And she ties into that because Cecilia has always worked, you know, for those issues.
And she's always, you know, she was working on the Boycott Graves campaign.
And, I mean, when she gets here, I mean, when she's here, you get here.
I mean, she's like a role model.
She's a role model.
Oh, man, like you haven't been tired.
No, we're talking about this.
No, let's say a role model and a role model.
She had her figure.
No, I guess basically because she helps in just keeping us here because it's hard to survive in a campus like this one.
You have people like Sunday nights at Flickstain, Beeners, Go Home, or, you know, same stuff like that here at Stanford.
I mean, are we supposed to survive in a climate that doesn't even accept us that you have to justify your existence?
And you need people like Cecilia Wursteiga and like Francis that just help you out just to make, like especially the transition from like your first year.
I mean, that's what helped me so much living in Zapata, my very first year is, you know, I survived the whole year because I was living there, I think.
Because, I mean, she helped that a lot, like with my parents and just everything.
I mean, I think she's an important contact for us.
I mean, there's so few of us here.
And then there's so few of our, you know, she got no one, she got no role models here that we can, you know, talk to and say, you know, hey, you know, this happened to me today.
Or, you know, I really, it's really strange for me to be here and not be back home where I see a lot of people who look like myself.
You know, and these are people that you can talk to like Cecilia, you know, she's, she's in, I mean, I find it incredible.
She always has time to hear us out always.
Yeah, when I was a freshman, like I have a really nice story about her that when I, well, I didn't for some dumb chance, I didn't get to live in Zapata my freshman year.
And so, so like I had a lot of problems like just trying to adapt and trying to try and decide like what I was going to do with my life.
And I had this whole big problem about deciding whether to be a doctor and secure a good financial future for myself and for my family or do what I really wanted to do was to be a teacher.
And my, my freshman advisor recommended that I go to her because he had heard so many nice things about her that he thought she could help me.
And I remember going into her office and just like crying my guts out because I didn't know what, I didn't know where I fit into this university.
And she talked, she had time, like she, she sat with me in her office and talked to me and encouraged me to do what, what I felt was right, you know, to let my heart decide.
And I mean, for the university not to recognize that she is capable of like keeping me here because I was ready to leave.
And she literally made me help me to stay. And if it wasn't for her, I mean I wouldn't be here.
All of you are members of Metsha, well, Metsha student in Giganas language, as long history.
What, what is the significance of this new phase? And I'm the first recipient of YouTube through the various events that started UCLA, UC San Barbara, Colorado, University of Colorado in Michigan State.
Virginia, too.
You talk about this in the context of the overall resurgence of Metsha and Giganas student activism.
I think as Metsha is the Giganas student movement and there's a long history of activism there, living back to the original planet of San Barbara.
And I think that each of us has maintained that goal of the betterment of La Rasa.
And our Metsha is very strong and we support with those founding machistas, came up with in terms of the promise in Paloara.
And it's gaining, it's in UCLA and UC San Barbara, another university's Metsha members and other organizations are taking leadership and moving the universities to meet the demands.
I think it's a great instrumental role.
They got misquoted?
Are they in support?
Yeah, what role is it?
What happened?
They're going to print it, they're going to print it.
That sucks.
Okay.
I feel bad for one of those.
But is he?
Oh yeah.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I was going to ask you, I know, earlier I talked to, you know, your dad, I talked to your mom.
I know from them that it's really quite to them.
I mean, they haven't been eating as well.
They also, you know, way also in the hunger strike.
How do you feel about your parents growing this?
How are you going to expand to your parents?
How do you have a really extended year?
How do you feel about your parents?
When I told my biggest worry in terms of disability,
in terms of deciding to take part in the fast, was how my mom was going to take it.
Because I thought she was going to, you know, get, she's an asthmatic and I thought she was going to get sick.
Because any time she stresses out, she has really bad attacks and stuff.
And I just, I just knew I was going to worry her and I was going to hurt her.
And that was the thing that scared me the most.
But I talked to her about it.
And I kind of eased her into it.
I started telling her first about the plan to stay out of the quadrant stuff like that.
And she was like, well, she told me.
Before I even mentioned to her that I was going to fact, she said,
when you are leading, when you are a leader and you want to take part in changing things when they're bad,
sometimes you have to make sacrifices.
She said, and, you know, whatever happened, you guys, you know, you have my prayers and you have my support.
And so then when I told her, she was like, oh, and I guess she maybe understood or was getting, you know,
I thought that I was going to get to that because I told her she was like, well,
she said, I'm not going to tell you to do it and I'm not going to tell you not to do it.
Because I don't want, I don't want to feel responsible for you doing it
and I don't want to feel responsible for you feeling bad because maybe it, you know,
it didn't succeed or because you weren't, you know, you really didn't want it to,
which you wanted to.
She said, but I'm really scared.
But she said that she had faith in God in this long as I had faith in God
that everything was going to be okay.
And so for me, it was very empowering because the minute I got off the phone,
I decided this is, I really felt strongly about it already.
And I decided that this is something I was going to do.
And even though I was going to cause her a lot of pain that I was going to get through it
and she was going to get through it.
And I'm pretty sure that she hasn't been eating either.
And I haven't been able to speak with her since that last time I talked to her.
But like she told me, she said, you know, she said for herself that she's already passed her use.
And she doesn't know that she can do that much anymore.
And she said, it's art her.
And so here we are.
We're trying to make changes because I don't want it.
I really don't want my little brother to have to do something like this.
And I have a younger sister who's here also.
And I don't want her to have to continue this.
I mean, she probably won't have to just because that's the way things are around here.
But if I can help out in some way so that the kids that come here later
don't have to be going through this, that would be awesome.
So yeah.
And if I don't question how has the university administration?
Okay.
Okay.
And I guess that was the hardest thing for me as well.
I knew like when we thought of the idea, I knew that I wanted to do it.
I wanted to be part of the hunger strike.
I just knew that I could do it.
And I was going to have the willpower to go through with it.
But the only thing was my mom.
I didn't know how to tell her.
I didn't know what to tell her.
I was scared because I know that.
The way my mom is she worries.
And she doesn't sleep that night.
And she can eat.
And it's just, it's bad.
I hate it.
I don't like doing that to her because she still works.
And she's getting older and everything.
But I don't know.
It's just something I felt so deep from my heart.
I just thought, you know, so many people are going to gain a lot from this.
So many people are going to, you know, have a lot of things come out of this.
Especially like with the Hispanic community center and with the boycott on the graves.
It's just immediate, like, help for people that are practically, that are dying and, you know,
being born with their birth defects.
So when I told her, you know, she was telling me, you know, she didn't want me to do it.
She was telling me, I'm anemic.
That I was anemic.
And my dad told me I had a low red blood cell count.
And there's just coming up with all these things that I had that I shouldn't be doing it
because I was so skinny and I was going to disappear and this and that.
So then, I'm sorry.
So then after, oh, when I told her, I mean, it was really hard.
She was crying and everything.
And then I called her after the first day of the hunger strike.
And she couldn't talk to me because she didn't want to cry on the phone.
So that that was just made me, I was just crying.
I was sucking in my sister and my sister's, you know, I was telling her,
tell my mom that I'm not hungry, tell her that I'm feeling good.
She's keeping me alive and you're going to keep me alive and I'm going to be okay.
But she's going to come today because she's worried and she wants to see me.
Well, the hardest part of this whole thing was just to tell my mom and dad, you know,
that I was going to do this because like we've all said, you know,
we don't want to make a suffer.
But I told her and she said, you know, okay, well, if you guys are still out there
after three days, you know, I'm going to come out.
And then the right, like a few minutes before I left, I was talking to her.
Even started on the 11th edition.
Do I have to try to say that?
Oh, okay.
And then, um, and then, um, so, you know, she was, she was crying and I could tell
and she was giving me the Vindicion.
And so she was like, you know what, I'm going to be up there tomorrow and stuff.
And, you know, my mom and dad got so many together and then so my mom could fly out here and stuff.
And, um, so she came out last night and I mean, I think it was better for her to come
because she, you know, she was upset when she saw me, she was crying and stuff.
But, you know, she's been really good and everybody's been really supportive of her.
And she's been, I think it makes her feel good to feel useful to this thing.
She feels a part of, a part of this strike.
And, you know, she feels a part of the movement and, you know, I think that, you know, she is
because, you know, we're fighting for her and for everybody.
And, you know, she slept out there with us last night.
So, she's hardcore.
For me, that was definitely the hardest part because after I did it, I was, I wish that I didn't,
that I didn't have to but I know that I, that if I hadn't, it would have been worse for her
if she had found out some other way.
So, um, I'm just really worried about it because she has heart problems.
And, um, I was afraid that if she saw me on the news or something, you know,
she would have put that through some of them, you know, and everything would be worse.
But, you know, she's fine and, and she already told me that she supports me
and even though it's the hardest thing, you know, for her.
Like, she, you know, I told her that it was her who taught me how to fight.
And, maybe that, hopefully that made her feel a little bit better, but maybe, hopefully, I don't know.
I don't know exactly how she is.
Our last time I talked to her, she sounded very weak.
And, um, my dad called me like the next morning, the morning after I told my mom,
and he tried his hardest to convince me not to do it.
He told me all kinds of things and he told me, why do you want to, why do you want to go through another hunger
after you've suffered so many hungers in your life?
And, just reminding me of all the things that I've had to go through just to get where I am
and trying to tell me, well, don't, you know, don't do it.
But, I still did it.
And, he's here right now and he came and told me, he's still trying to convince me to stop
because he goes, he says, if, you know, your mom's going to come up here tomorrow
and you're still on the strike, she's going to strike with you.
So, I don't know.
I think, generally, my parents have the same feelings as all the others do.
But, it's a little bit easier for them to handle because tonight's going to be my last day if I was to.
So, it's basically it.
And, that's worried, you know?
Well, okay.
You said it's for historical purposes, right?
So, when, you know, 20 years for now and other Chicanas look at this, you know,
in Chicanas.
In Chicanas.
Sorry.
I'm tired of, you know, another hint to see this.
Just to remember that, you know, even when you're looking at this now, 20 years later,
the movement is still alive and you, we still have to keep struggling because, you know.
Well, hopefully we can stop.
Hopefully we can stop some of it, but I mean, if it's still, it's still bad, you know, for 20 years now, you know.
We can do it, you know.
I want to take advantage of what you have.
I guess, like, for us, it's very important to say, oh, we have it.
We have it sent through and there's a lot of people that worked hard for it.
Don't settle for what you have.
Don't settle for what you have.
And don't forget us pretty much.
Don't forget the people who fought before you.
All the things like the people that fought before us and before us and before them.
And just remember, you know, we're doing this for you for the future.
First of all, I feel like I was a young rookie.
I feel like I was a young rookie.
What's the new message about this?
What's the big...
It is currently about 730 on the 6th of May, Friday, 1994.
We have just collected witness the five testimonials from five of the hunger strikers which
have included at one point over 100 solidarity strikers.
At this time we received the latest response from the administration which has been recalcitrant
up to this point and I understand that there are still many points that need to be reviewed
and some more dialogue that needs to take place but at the moment it looks as though a statement
that we have made as a community, the Chicano community and the statement that comes from
various communities throughout the Bay Area and the nation and solidarity with us has
opened or begun to open the administration's eyes to the justice of our cause and our demands.
However, as I said, there still is some work to be done.
For the moment, it seems as though our first demand, that is the offering of a high level
position to associate deans in Celebusiaga, is still not being met and as I said, this
is our first demand and it is very important to us.
Some more negotiation has to go on with regards to that.
The second demand involves the establishment of a community center and East Bado Alto
to serve the community that literally works to preserve the functioning of this university and as far as the
university's administration is concerned, they are receptive to the initiative that the Chicano
students have presented in terms of bridging the gap between the community and the academy.
This has been a very important component to the struggle here as a matter of fact.
This is a component that isn't new.
It goes all the way back to the plan de Santa Barbara, which inaugurated Mecha.
So we are very hopeful that some breakthrough will come through here.
As regards to the Chicano and Chicano studies, again, this is the justice and the feasibility
of this demand has led the administration to also give overtures that are encouraging.
Finally, the issue of Great Plum Campus has, and specifically, the negative reactions,
the racist reactions to our efforts to educate the community at Stanford and our protest against
those negative reactions has led the university to embark upon an initiative to educate all the
dorms through the showing of the no-grates video and also through establishing a dialogue
with our community, the Chicano community, in an effort to bridge the gaps that have been
caused by the racism that is very often a result of an academy which is very hierarchical
and one which is institutionally, structurally hostile to the presence of minorities and other
marginalized people.
With this, I would just like to say, we are going to win this one.
