My name is Evira Frieto, I'm a sophomore in human biology here.
I'm from Reedley, California, which is a small agricultural town in the San Joaquin Valley.
My parents are migrant workers and I've worked in the fields with them all my life
up until I started coming to school.
My name is Eva Silva, I'm a senior majoring in human biology with an emphasis on education
and the diverse classroom.
And I'm from Salinas, California and I'm going to be a math teacher.
My name is Tamar Alvarado and I'm a majoring in Spanish Chicano Studies.
I'm from a town in San Joaquin, Escondido and um, what else, that's it for now.
My name is Julia Gonzales Luna, I'm a senior majoring in public policy with a focus on
education and um, I'm from Burbank, California and I'm going to be a math teacher.
I'm going to be a social studies um, high school teacher.
Do you want to ask some questions here as to how this started and how did it start?
And your own words, how did it start, how did this hunger strike start and why?
How did it start?
Speak to us as if we don't know.
Okay.
Well, I guess it was a buildup of a lot of um, different things that have been happening
not only on this campus but overall in this nation with the status of Chicanos and Chicanas
in the United States and the universities and everywhere else.
So um, you know, I guess I can run down like since my freshman year so many things have
happened, the closing down of the Office of Chicanos Affairs and then um, with all the
threats with the budget cuts to the ethnic centers and just these attacks on the theme
houses on the ethnic centers and everything else and then the laying off of Cecilia Bursiaga.
I mean everything just like piled down piled down and so many things were happening that
we say wait, we need to do something about it and we need to change what's going on because
nothing's happening that we want to happen.
I'm tired.
I'm sorry.
I love you so much.
I'm sorry.
So I'm just wondering why you would need to take a drastic measure like this?
Absolutely.
You'll say why didn't you?
Because the administration has been very, and whenever we've had like meetings and townhouse
meetings or whatever, we get together with um, any of the administrators.
We don't get any results that we're happy with and so it seemed to me like for them
to really understand how extreme the situation is on this campus and how extreme things are
outside in terms of immigrant bashing and just the way that people in Ispa Lo Alto are,
that it was maybe the only way that they would, that it would, I don't know if it would touch
their hearts or if they would just stop to think about it or if we could get enough bad
press for this university so that they could finally just really think about it because
otherwise they weren't paying attention.
It was just like everything had to go business as usual and there seemed to be this idea about
hierarchy here that it was from top down.
It was what they said first and then if we could deal with that, if we as students could
deal with, excuse me, what the university wanted, well then that was fine.
And if we couldn't, that's too bad because they're at their position because they earned
it or whatever.
Yeah, because meeting after meeting, like, you didn't get anything concrete from meeting
with them every single time.
It was just, okay, I'll give you a meeting from six to seven.
I'll give you a meeting from five thirty to six or whatever.
We've tried their methods.
We've tried their methods of working things out and their methods are to draw things out
for as long as possible in order to not give us things.
Yeah, at least, you know, they may say differently but that's what it feels like and it's ridiculous
to have to spend, I'm sorry, I'm slow but a little bit tired.
It's ridiculous to spend so much time just talking and talking about things and, you
know, they're trying to tire us out with just talking.
So that's what it had to come to.
And, you know, when people are not heard, you know, and this happens in society at large,
when people are not heard, yeah, you know, I don't know if I want to say abnormal behaviors
but, you know, behaviors that are not normal, behaviors that are not normal are what happened
and, yeah, this is not normal.
You know, this is not normal behavior for us to be, you know, not eating.
But, you know.
I really like to eat.
Yeah, we like to eat.
And, you know, I just want to emphasize, you know, why are chicanos in prison?
Why are chicanos, you know, in poverty?
That's not normal.
That's not normal for people.
But because of society, that's how we are.
And we've waited long enough for this.
I mean, I know the administration is probably thinking, well, you know, be patient
and these changes will happen.
But we've been patient long enough.
And, you know, the Chicano studies major has been, it was envisioned back in the 70s,
even the 60s.
And we've been waiting since then.
And it's about time that we get recognized.
Chicanos are the biggest, are coming to be a majority in California.
And, you know, maybe even in the whole country after a while.
But, I mean, it's about time that our issues get recognized.
And that other people just realize that we're not going to go away.
And if they don't educate themselves about us, then it's just going to be worse for them.
Oh, did you co-authored a really beautiful performance in the title?
It's almost my head.
What, for you, is the significance of having the four Chicanas taking the Vanguard role
in this movement, which is really bigger than this campus?
For me, I mean, I don't know.
We didn't really realize it was four women until somebody pointed it out to us.
I mean, we knew it was girls.
But we didn't see it like, you know, oh, you know, there's no guys here.
And, you know, like, you know, what's up with the guys?
But I don't know.
I mean, we have a lot of supporters at our mail.
And maybe they didn't say they're going to go for the long run.
But they've been, you know, there the whole time.
Everybody, like, has their roles.
And it's like, there's some people that are the negotiators.
There's people that are security over here.
There's, like, everybody has their roles.
And, you know, we're not the most important.
Because if it wasn't for them, then, you know, nobody would be listening to us or whatever.
And there's other people that have been fasting also, like Felipe Serinova-Barrigan.
He's been fasting these three days with us as well.
And, like, there's people that committed to three days and others that do one-day cycles
to show their support and solidarity.
It's true. There are a lot of males that are doing really important stuff
in terms of really trying, you know, like with the rest of the women also,
trying to take care of us and trying to watch out for this.
And they're just constantly looking out to see what, you know, what we need
or what needs to be done for the whole group.
And so it's, I don't know.
I don't know that it's specifically a female thing to be fasting or anything like that.
Because I think everybody really does have their own role
and everybody's been really supportive and we're working together.
It's really accurate.
It just so happened that we were the ones that, you know,
we're the ones that, you know, were ready mentally at this time too fast.
And, you know, it just so happens that we're all women.
People are kindness guerrillas and revolucionaires and all that.
That's, I mean, that's fine.
That's nice. That's really nice.
I mean, everybody's been revolutionary.
And, you know, it comes down to, you know, I don't want to say your talent.
I don't think our talent is to be hungry, but pretty much like everybody
is taking on the role that is best suited for themselves.
There's Felipe.
You know, of all the things that you could have done,
of all the actions you could have taken, why fasting?
Why did you choose to fast?
Well, it's obviously a really strong statement.
You know, it's something that it's uncompromising
and it's something that shows just how serious we are about these issues.
They're issues that our fathers, grandfathers, and people way before us
have fought for and we have a responsibility to those ancestors of ours
to make sure that those dreams that they had, that vision they had, is fulfilled.
We can't just, you know, it may be 20 years, 20, 30, 20 years later
from the, you know, the Chicano movement that people think is dead,
but it's not dead. We're here and we're living and we're the Chicano movement.
The Chicano movement.
Yeah.
Chicano, Chicano.
Felipe, you just joined us,
but actually you've been with us throughout this whole struggle from the beginning
as was pointed out.
Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, where you're from,
and your reflections on this struggle?
Sure. My name is Felipe Barragan.
I'm a freshman originally from Los Angeles, California.
This struggle, I think, for me, it's something that's very important
because I went to high school in Watts
and a lot of people know what Watts is like.
In 1965, Watts Rebellion, the 92 Riots,
there I saw issues that the educational system
for high school students in Chicano, Latinos there,
wasn't addressing the real issues.
Once I came here, I got a taste of it.
I got a taste of Chicano studies,
and I found out how crucial that was.
And I think that getting involved with this struggle is important for me
to build the processes with which we learn to deal with intercity,
to wipe out the marginalization of our people.
In terms of your actions,
a lot of people are probably thinking that you came here to study
and that you should be in the classroom, not protesting.
So you're making a decision because it is a pretty tough university to be at.
There's a lot of demands and you're kind of out there really taking a big chance.
How did you make that decision?
I guess the main thing is,
I never, when I came here, I didn't want to come and just study
and go to class and go back home, study, do my work,
and just concentrate on myself while there's people out there,
there's students in the high schools that are getting pushed out of the schools,
there's the farm workers that are getting treated badly,
there's kids being born without hands because of the pesticides that they put on the grapes.
I mean, I can't just sit and concentrate on my own work
and not worry about what's going on because that's my people,
that's my parents, that's my family, that's everybody.
I wouldn't be able to live with myself without doing anything about it.
I wouldn't be able to live with myself with just thinking about myself and my career
and getting straight A's and doing my resumes and stuff like that.
I wouldn't be able to do that.
I mean, both things can be done.
I think that we're doing this so that later generations of Stanford,
Chicanos and Chicanos don't have to do it.
Today we had little chicanitas and chicanitos from East Palo Alto come out
and from a Valle Foclorico group called Drazes in Mexico
and they came out and they came out and supported us.
They're just little kids.
I don't know, they're probably like from five to like twelve maybe.
And the reason we're doing this now and sacrificing our academic times
or study hours or whatever,
so that when they come here, they can focus on doing the things that they need to do
instead of having to struggle so much.
I mean, I think it's just like our parents.
They struggle so that we don't have to struggle.
We're still struggling, but at a different level.
We don't have to worry.
Once we get out of here, we're not going to have to worry about
where am I going to get something to eat like before
or how are we going to pay the bills.
We're probably going to be able to pay even our parents' bills.
I think it also goes back to the question about why did we choose a hunger strike.
It's kind of like, we know that our grades are going to suffer from this
and we're not going to graduate with a great GPA as we could have.
I mean, it's to show that we know that we're capable of doing a work
but we feel so strongly about this that we're willing to do a little bit worse than everybody else
because our issues are so important.
I mean, I don't know if the administration sees that,
but I don't know if anybody sees that.
I know that I could be a nice student,
but I choose to better be like a human being first
and to care more about my people than about my grades.
I was going to ask you, related to the incident that happened on Sunday
at the Flix, the film No Clues of Shrooms,
how do you feel or what steps can the university take to educate the student community
and the staff and faculty about the issue of ongoing racism,
the issue of why it's important to have abandoned grades on this campus?
How do you think the university can take a proactive role in educating the community?
If they really truly believe that that isn't right, that the incident at Flix isn't right
or that people should know and should understand that the pesticides
and the harm that they're doing to people is wrong,
then they should take it upon themselves to educate this university.
If they really feel responsible for the education of their students,
if they believe that that is an important issue,
that people's lives and people's health and the reaction of some or a lot of students
finding that amusing, there's something wrong with that.
There's something wrong with the mentality or with the ignorance level
or something of the students at this university and they are responsible
because they're the administrators, they're in charge of this school.
They're here to serve the students but they're also here to help educate them
and to me that proved just a lot of ignorance.
It didn't surprise me but it was very offensive and it was very disrespectful
and if they really, if they agree with that at all, then it's their responsibility to deal with it.
I mean the main things that we're, you know, just to bring up what we're striking about,
you know, we have these issues that we have been dealing with as a community for a long time
and, you know, one of them being a campus band on Graves,
the development of a Chicano studies program,
and the community center in Ispa Lo Alto.
And, you know, there's certain things that we can talk about specifically
in the offer for Cecilia Buxerga, a high level position for Cecilia Buxerga,
a high level administrator here, a Chicano administrator.
Why is it important for the university to recognize Cecilia's contributions?
Why is Cecilia's position in Cecilia's role included among these other three?
Well, basically because it ties down to the whole approach that we're taking,
that our education isn't addressing the real issues, you know, the issues being in poverty,
the joblessness and, you know, the overrepresentation we have in the jails and just everything.
And she ties into that because Cecilia has always worked, you know, for those issues.
She's always, you know, she was working on the Boycott Graves campaign.
And, I mean, and when she gets here, I mean, when she's here, you get here.
I mean, she's like a role model.
A role model?
Oh, man, I'm getting tired.
Oh, no.
Yeah, well, we're talking about she's a role model and a role mother.
Mother figure.
That's it.
No, I guess basically because she helps in just keeping us here because it's hard to survive
in a campus like this.
When you have people like Sunday nights at Flick St, beiners go home or, you know,
same stuff like that here at Stanford.
I mean, how are we supposed to survive in a climate that doesn't even accept us,
that you have to justify your existence?
And you need people like Cecilia Gustiaga and like Francis that just help you out just to make,
like especially the transition from like your first year.
I mean, that's what helped me so much living in Zapata my very first year is, you know,
I survived the whole year because I was living there, I think, because I mean,
she helped out a lot, like with my parents and just everything.
I mean, I think like they're always caring for you.
She's an important, important contact for us.
I mean, there's so, so few of us here.
And then there's so few of our, you know, Chicano and Chicano role models
here that we can, you know, talk to and say, you know, hey, you know,
this happened to me today or, you know, I really, it's really strange for me to be here
and not be back home where I see a lot of people who look like myself, you know,
and these are people that you can talk to like Cecilia, you know, she's, she's,
I mean, I find it incredible.
She always has time to hear us out.
Always.
Yeah.
When, when I was a freshman, like I have a really nice story about her that when I,
well, I didn't, for some dumb chance, I didn't get to live in Zapata my freshman year.
And so, so like I had a lot of problems, like just trying to adapt and trying to,
trying to decide like what I was going to do with my life.
And I had this whole big problem about deciding whether to be a doctor and secure
a good financial future for myself and for my family or do what I really wanted to do
was to be a teacher.
And my, my freshman advisor recommended that I go to her because he had heard so many nice things
about her that he thought she could help me.
And I remember going into her office and just like crying my guts out because I didn't know what,
I didn't know where I fit into this university.
And she talked, she had time.
Like she, she sat with me in her office and talked to me and encouraged me to do what,
what I felt was right, you know, to let my heart decide.
And I mean, for the university not to recognize that she is capable of like keeping me here
because I was ready to leave.
And she, she literally made me, helped me to stay.
And if it wasn't for her, I mean, I wouldn't be here.
All of you are members of MEDCHA.
What is the significance of this new phase?
And I'm very specific to the various events that started UCLA, UC, Santa Barbara, Colorado,
University of Colorado and Michigan State.
Virginia, too.
And Virginia, too.
What is the context of the overall resurgence of MEDCHA and Chicano Student Activism?
I think as MEDCHA is the Chicano Student Movement.
And there's a long history of activism there.
Getting back to the original planet, Plan de Santa Barbara.
And I think that each of us has maintained that goal of the betterment of La Raza.
And our MEDCHA is very strong and we support what those founding machistas came up with
in terms of Plan de Santa Barbara.
And it's gaining, it's in UCLA and UC Santa Barbara and other universities, MEDCHA members
and other organizations are taking leadership and moving the universities to meet the demands.
I think it's playing an instrumental role.
They got misquoted?
Are they in support?
Yeah.
So what happened?
That sucks.
Oh yeah.
Sorry.
I was going to ask you, I know earlier I talked to, you know, your dad.
I talked to your mom.
I know from them that it's been really hard for them.
I mean, they haven't been eating as well.
They're also in a way also in the hunger strike of youth.
How do you feel, how about your parents' role in this?
How are you going to explain it to your parents as much as you already haven't really explained it to them?
Well, my biggest worry in terms of deciding to take part in the FAST was how my mom was going to take it.
Because I thought she was going to, you know, she's an asthmatic and I thought she was going to get sick
because any time she stresses out she has really bad attacks and stuff.
And I just knew I was going to worry her and I was going to hurt her and that was the thing that scared me the most.
But I talked to her about it and I kind of eased her into it.
I started telling her first about the plan to stay out in the quad and stuff like that.
And she was like, well, she told me before I even mentioned to her that I was going to FAST
she said, well, Miha, when you are a leader and you want to take part in changing things when they're bad
sometimes you have to make sacrifices.
She said, and you know, whatever happened, you guys, you know, you have my prayers and you have my support.
And then when I told her, she was like, oh, and I guess she maybe understood or was getting, you know,
thought that I was going to get to that.
Because I told her and she was like, well, she said, I'm not going to tell you to do it
and I'm not going to tell you not to do it because I don't want to feel responsible for you doing it
and I don't want to feel responsible for you feeling bad because maybe, you know, it didn't succeed
or because you weren't, you know, you really didn't want to do what you wanted to.
She said, but I'm really scared, but she said that she had faith in God
and as long as I had faith in God that everything was going to be okay.
And so for me, it was very empowering because the minute I got off the phone, I decided,
I really felt strongly about it already and I decided that this was something I was going to do
and even though I was going to cause her a lot of pain, that I was going to get through it
and that she was going to get through it and I'm pretty sure that she hasn't been eating either
and I haven't been able to speak with her since that last time I talked to her.
But like she told me, she said, you know, she said for herself that she's already passed her youth
and she doesn't know that she can do that much anymore and she said, it's our turn.
And so here we are, we're trying to make changes because I really don't want my little brother
to have to do something like this and I have a younger sister who's here also
and I don't want her to have to continue this.
I mean, she probably won't have to just because that's the way things are around here
but if I can help out in some way so that the kids that come here later
don't have to be going through this, then that would be awesome.
Yeah.
If I find a question, how has the university administration?
Okay, can I go?
Yeah, you can go.
Okay, I guess that was the hardest thing for me as well.
It's like, I knew, like when we thought of the idea, I knew that I wanted to do it.
I wanted to be part of the hunger strike.
I just knew that I could do it and I was going to have the willpower to go through it.
But the only thing was my mom, I didn't know how to tell her, I didn't know what to tell her.
I was scared because I know that the way my mom is, she worries and she doesn't sleep that night
and she can't eat and it's just, it's bad, I hate it.
I don't like doing that to her because she still works and she's getting older and everything
but I don't know, it's just something that I felt so deep from my heart.
I just thought, you know, so many people are going to gain a lot from this.
So many people are going to, you know, have a lot of things come out of this,
especially like with the East Palo Alto Community Center and with the boycott on the graves.
It's just immediate like help for people that are practically, that are dying
and you know, being born with birth defects.
So when I told her, you know, she was telling me, you know, she didn't want me to do it.
She was telling me I'm anemic, that I was anemic.
Then my dad told me I had a low red blood cell count.
They were just coming up with all these things that I had that I shouldn't be doing it
because I was so skinny and I was going to disappear and this and that.
So then, so then after, oh, when I told her, I mean, it was really hard.
She was crying and everything.
And then I called her after the first day of the hunger strike
and she couldn't talk to me because she didn't want to cry on the phone.
So that, that was just made me, I was just crying.
I was talking to my sister and my sister was, you know, I was telling her,
tell my mom that I'm not hungry, tell her that I'm feeling good,
that she's keeping me alive and they're going to keep me alive and I'm going to be okay.
So, but she's going to come today because she's worried and she wants to see me.
Well, the hardest part of this whole thing was just to, to tell my mom and dad,
you know, that I was going to do this because like we've all said, you know,
we don't want to make them suffer.
But I told her and she said, you know, okay,
well, if you guys are still out there after three days and I'm going to come out
and then the right, like a few minutes before I left, I was talking to her
and she was crying and I could tell and she was giving me the blessing.
And so she was like, you know what, I'm going to be out there tomorrow and stuff.
And, you know, my mom and dad got some money together and then,
so my mom could fly out here and stuff.
And so she, she came out last night and I mean, I think it was better for her
to be out there tomorrow.
And she was like, you know what, I'm going to be out there tomorrow
and stuff and you know, my mom and dad got some money together
last night and I mean, I think it was better for her to come
because she was upset when she saw me.
She was crying and stuff, but you know, she's been really good
and everybody's been really supportive of her and she's been,
I think it makes her feel good to feel useful to this thing.
She feels a part of this strike and you know, she feels a part of the movement
and you know, I think that, you know, she is because you know,
we're fighting for her and for everybody.
And you know, she slept out there with us last night.
So, she's hardcore.
For me, that was definitely the hardest part because,
and after I did it, I wish that I didn't, that I didn't have to,
but I know that if I hadn't, it would have been worse for her
if she had found out some other way.
So, I'm just really worried about her because she has heart problems
and I was afraid that if she saw me on the news or something,
you know, we had everything, we were split.
But you know, she's fine and she already told me that she supports me
and even though it's the hardest thing, you know, for her,
she knows, I told her that it was her who taught me how to fight
and maybe that, hopefully that made her feel a little bit better
but maybe hopefully, I don't know.
I don't know exactly how she is.
Our last time I talked to her, she sounded very weak
and my dad called me like the next morning,
the morning after I told my mom
and he tried his hardest to convince me not to do it.
He told me all kinds of things
and he told me, why do you want to go through another hunger
after you've suffered so many hungers in your life
and just reminding me of all the things that I've had to go through
just to get where I am and trying to tell me, well, don't do it.
But I still did it and he's here right now
and he came and told me he's still trying to convince me to stop
because he goes, he says, you know, your mom's going to come up here tomorrow
and if you're still on the strike, she's going to strike with you.
So I don't know.
I think generally my parents have the same feelings as all of theirs do
but it's a little bit easier for them to handle
because tonight's going to be my last day fasting.
So that's basically it.
Last word?
Well, okay.
You said it's for historical purposes, right?
So when, you know, 20 years from now
when other Chicanas look at this, you know,
In Chicanas.
Sorry, I'm tired.
I can't see this.
Just to remember that, you know,
even when you're looking at this now, 20 years later,
the movement is still alive in you
and we still have to keep struggling because, you know.
Well, hopefully we can stop.
Hopefully we can stop some of it.
But I mean, if it's still bad, you know,
20 years from now, you know, we can do it.
And don't take advantage of what you have.
I guess like for us, it's very important to say,
oh, we have El Centro and there's a lot of people
that worked hard for it.
Don't settle for what you have.
Don't settle for what you have.
And don't forget us pretty much.
Don't forget the people who fought before you.
All the things like the people that fought before us
and before them and just remember,
you know, we're doing this for you, for the future.
For the future.
So, okay.
The new message is this.
It is currently about 7.30 on the 6th of May,
Friday, 1994.
We have just collected, witnessed the five testimonials
from five of the hunger strikers,
which have included at one point
over 100 solidarity strikers.
At this time, we've received the latest response
from the administration, which has been recalcitrant
up to this point.
And I understand that there's still many points
that need to be reviewed and some more dialogue
that needs to be, that needs to take place.
But at the moment, it looks as though a statement
that we have made as a community, the Chicano community,
and a statement that comes from various communities
throughout the Bay Area and the nation
in solidarity with us has begun to open
the administration's eyes to the justness
of our cause and our demands.
However, as I said, there still is some work to be done.
For the moment, it seems as though our first demand,
that is the offering of a high-level position
to Associate Dean Cecilia Bursiaga,
is still not being met.
And as I said, this is our first demand
and it's very important to us.
Some more negotiation has to go on with regards to that.
The second demand involves the establishment
of a community center in East Balu Alto
to serve the community that literally works
to preserve the functioning of this university.
And as far as the university's administration is concerned,
they are receptive to the initiative
that the Chicano students have presented
in terms of bridging the gap
between the community and the academy.
This has been a very important component
to the struggle here.
As a matter of fact, this is a component that isn't new.
It goes all the way back to the Plan de Santa Barbara,
which inaugurated Mecha.
So we are very hopeful that some breakthrough
will come through here.
As regards to the Chicano and Chicano studies,
again, this is the justice
and the feasibility of this demand
has led the administration to also give overtures
that are encouraging.
Finally, the issue of grapes on campus
and specifically the negative reactions,
the racist reactions to our efforts
to educate the community at Stanford
and our protest against those negative reactions
has led the university to embark upon an initiative
to educate all the dorms
through the showing of the No Grades video
and also through establishing a dialogue
with our community, the Chicano community,
in an effort to bridge the gaps
that have been caused,
bridged the divisions that have been caused
by the racism that's very often a result
of an academy which is very hierarchical
and one which is institutionally, structurally hostile
to the presence of minorities
and other marginalized people.
With this, I would just like to say
que viva la raza y adelante.
We're going to win this one.
Thank you.
